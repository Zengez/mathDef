## 189. maximal finite chain connecting primes — `missing.33bd557af9c1505ff986`

**retain_distinct_missing**, 1/1 parents. A saturated chain fixes endpoints and admits no intermediate prime between adjacent terms. It is not an arbitrary strict prime chain, its length, or a maximal ideal. Maximal under insertion need not mean longest: two branches of a poset can be saturated with different lengths. Catenarity imposes equality and boundedness of lengths separately, without a Noetherian hypothesis here. Under Spec the corresponding irreducible-closed chain reverses inclusion, retaining its ambient ring and endpoints.

## 190. additive multiple n·1_F — `missing.34ce94b98a483565bed3`

**retain_distinct_missing**, 1/1 parents. n·1_F is repeated ADDITION, not the multiplicative power 1_F^n, which is always 1. It is the image of n under Z→F and need not vanish. The least positive vanishing n determines characteristic; if n=ab with 1<a,b<n, then (a·1)(b·1)=0 contradicts the absence of zero divisors, proving prime characteristic. Characteristic zero is a convention for no positive vanishing index, not a positive n=0 test.

## 191. induced isomorphism of residue fields — `missing.35f080be8784ff208377`

**retain_distinct_missing**, 1/1 parents. Inclusion induces Λ/(Λ∩m)→R/m, injective by its kernel. Surjectivity requires Λ+m=R and is not automatic for an arbitrary subring. For instance Q⊂R as fields gives an injective residue map Q→R which is not onto. When bijective it is the specified induced field isomorphism, not an arbitrary abstract isomorphism between residue fields, nor the residue-field object or completion. The condition Λ∩m=pΛ remains extra.

Remaining: No external citation or whole-parent theorem certification; source/graph unchanged.

## 192. multiplicative group F× of field units — `missing.366fd59d8e50c00508ab`

**retain_distinct_missing**, 1/1 parents. F× consists of nonzero field elements under multiplication; closure follows because ab=0 would force a=0 or b=0. Inverses and 1 give its group structure. It is not the additive group (which contains 0), the field with both operations, or μ_n(F), a subgroup selected by x^n=1. For F=Q, 2∈F× but is not a root of unity. Commutativity permits product/inverse closure of μ_n, without asserting n distinct roots in positive characteristic.

Remaining: No external citation or whole-parent theorem certification; source/graph unchanged.

## 193. left and right Ore-square completion — `missing.3710b4975d74d6cf4a18`

**retain_distinct_missing**, 1/1 parents. An Ore square completes a compatible span/cospan with an S-arrow on the opposite side; it need not be a universal pushout or pullback. For f:X→Y and s:X→X′ in S, a typical direction asks t:Y→Y′ in S and f′:X′→Y′ with tf=f′s, plus the dual condition. Identities/composition alone do not guarantee this existence, and denominator cancellation is a separate axiom. The source abbreviates the exact direction conventions rather than specifying a new ring denominator set.

Remaining: Later source population must recover exact eligible arrows, direction conventions and S-placement; no unprovided universal-square axiom is inferred.

## 194. rational-coefficient polynomial P(n) — `missing.37f3dd1bcc4e4d93bbe3`

**retain_distinct_missing**, 1/1 parents. A rational polynomial P(T) is an element of Q[T]; P(n) is its evaluated value. These are not the whole polynomial algebra or an arbitrary eventually polynomial integer sequence. T(T−1)/2 has rational coefficients and integer values on integer n, so eventual integer length values do not force integer coefficients. Two rational polynomials agreeing for all sufficiently large n are equal, since a nonzero difference has finitely many roots. Preserve the polynomial/value/algebra granularity in any later candidate compression.

Remaining: The generic polynomial-algebra prerequisite covers the ambient construction only; no alias of a polynomial element or its values to the whole algebra is proposed.

## 195. intersection of all maximal ideals — `missing.3805a426422444ccd427`

**retain_distinct_missing**, 1/1 parents. The indexed intersection consists of r belonging to every selected ideal and is an ideal by closure of each input. Empty intersection is R, including the zero-ring/no-maximal-ideal case under the chosen convention. Selecting ALL maximal ideals yields Jac(R); selecting prime ideals instead gives a different construction in general. The intersection operation is not the distinguished Jacobson radical itself. In a local ring its maximal-ideal intersection is m, not necessarily the nilradical.

Remaining: Retain the earlier exact Jacobson/local ring convention questions; do not certify unitality from the bare source label.

## 196. arbitrary unions of open subsets — `missing.388535dfa4c978e2cd14`

**retain_distinct_missing**, 1/1 parents. Arbitrary union includes a point iff at least one indexed member contains it, with empty union ∅. Unlike tagged disjoint union, repeated/shared elements appear once. The operation is independent of openness; closure under it defines a topology axiom. Countable union is a restricted instance and does not supply arbitrary-union closure: the countable/cocountable sigma-algebra on an uncountable set need not contain every union of singletons. Empty X and empty indexing cause no problem.

Remaining: No external citation or whole-parent theorem certification; source/graph unchanged.

## 197. every nonzero element has two-sided inverse — `missing.3913df323abde5188991`

**retain_distinct_missing**, 1/1 parents. The source requires a two-sided inverse witness for each nonzero ring element; it does not impose commutativity. Inverses are unique by b=b(ac)=(ba)c=c. The existing unit predicate expresses existence of such a witness for a specified element, whereas this candidate names the inverse witness and the parent universally quantifies nonzero elements. One-sided inverses need not suffice in arbitrary rings; shift and retraction operators on an infinite-dimensional vector space give AB=id but BA≠id. No identity of the whole division ring with a unit or inverse is claimed.

Remaining: No external citation or whole-parent theorem certification; source/graph unchanged.

## 198. radical of an ideal I — `missing.393011a6247b68c99dfd`

**retain_distinct_missing**, 1/1 parents. sqrt(I)={r:some positive power lies in I} is an operation on ideals, not the property I being radical or the Jacobson radical. For commutative R it is an ideal: binomial expansion makes (a+b)^(m+n) lie in I when a^m,b^n do; scalar closure is immediate. In Z, sqrt((4))=(2), illustrating that input and output may differ. The local condition sqrt(I)=m selects ideals after forming this operation and does not define the operation only for m-primary inputs.

Remaining: No external citation or whole-parent theorem certification; source/graph unchanged.

## 199. equipotent to A — `missing.3e301ed859563004e0bc`

**retain_distinct_missing**, 1/1 parents. Equipotence is existence of a bijection between two sets, not a chosen bijection or identity of the sets. A={0} and B={1} are equipotent but different; inverse and composition show symmetry and transitivity. A witnessing bijection carries extra data and may be nonunique. Representing cardinality by a least equipotent ordinal additionally requires A to be well-orderable; in a foundation without Choice this is not automatic for every set. The equipotence predicate itself needs no such assumption.

Remaining: The host cardinality sentence needs its well-orderability/Choice universe convention before universal certification; no foundational assumption added here.

## 200. points closed in ambient X — `missing.3ee6d84a80479e5aff32`

**retain_distinct_missing**, 1/1 parents. A closed point means its singleton is closed in the specified ambient space; it does not assert T1 for all points. For x∈Z with Z closed in X, {x} closed in Z is equivalent to closed in X by transitivity of closed subspaces, so there is no conflict between those readings in THIS parent. The generic point of Spec(Z) is not closed, while points (p) are. Jacobson density in every closed Z is extra, not part of being one closed point.

Remaining: No external citation or whole-parent theorem certification; source/graph unchanged.

## 201. left translation by group element g — `missing.4167733e7b5f389c9f46`

**retain_distinct_missing**, 1/1 parents. L_g(h)=gh is a bijection with inverse L_(g^−1), and gH is its image on H. It is generally not a group homomorphism: L_g(e)=g, so preservation of identity forces g=e. Right translation h↦hg is different in nonabelian groups, and conjugation has the extra right factor g^−1. Thus the map, its subset image, and the coset space are different objects. The scalar multiplication map from field norm is linear rather than this group translation.

Remaining: No external citation or whole-parent theorem certification; source/graph unchanged.

## 202. sheaf of rings O_X — `missing.42dd118d20d40e57e2b9`

**source_convention_deferral**, 1/1 parents. A ring sheaf assigns rings and restriction homomorphisms to opens, with unique gluing of compatible sections; it is not a stalk, section ring, or the canonical Spec(R) sheaf. On a one-point space the sheaf with value Z is not locally ringed, showing local stalks are extra. The canonical candidate explicitly requires unital rings and unital restrictions, whereas the stored source merely says sheaf of rings and invokes the already deferred local-ring convention. Do not certify those additional unit conventions from the attribution alone.

Remaining: Later verify ring-sheaf identity/restriction conventions alongside the existing local-ring source deferral; no general/unital structures merged.

## 203. 1-morphism C/U→Y — `missing.431551548bd74bda58b6`

**retain_distinct_missing**, 1/1 parents. This 1-morphism is a functor from C/U over C, not an individual fibre arrow or a vertical natural transformation. Its projection equation p_Y H=projection_(C/U) is essential. In categories fibred in groupoids every arrow is cartesian, so an over-base functor between these preserves cartesian arrows; this does not identify such functors with 2-cells. Every U and every such test functor is quantified before forming a 2-fibre product, not only a single chosen point.

Remaining: No external citation or whole-parent theorem certification; source/graph unchanged.

## 204. irreducible closed subset Z of X — `missing.436a89a3c048eae81a6c`

**retain_distinct_missing**, 1/1 parents. Z is a nonempty irreducible space WITH its closed embedding in X. Intrinsic irreducibility alone supplies no ambient closedness: the generic singleton in Spec(Z) is irreducible but not closed. It need not be an irreducible component, which is maximal under inclusion. A generic point additionally has closure exactly Z and need not exist in every irreducible closed subset; uniqueness needs an appropriate separation/sobriety condition. Preserve nonempty scope and the source embedding rather than resolve to an abstract irreducible-space meaning alone.

Remaining: No external citation or whole-parent theorem certification; source/graph unchanged.

## 205. common zero of f and g — `missing.4392269bbeb1c466e0bc`

**retain_distinct_missing**, 1/1 parents. A common zero is one α in a specified extension satisfying BOTH evaluations, not a root of either polynomial independently or a formal gcd. Testing only k-rational zeros is inadequate: over Q, f=g=T²+1 have no rational zero but share roots over an algebraic closure and are not coprime. If gcd=1, a Bezout identity evaluated at a common zero contradicts 1=0; conversely a nonconstant gcd has a root in the algebraic closure. Zero/constant polynomials must retain the same evaluation convention.

Remaining: No external citation or whole-parent theorem certification; source/graph unchanged.

## 206. tuple of locally defined module sections m_i — `missing.44950d7527b95655e385`

**retain_distinct_missing**, 1/1 parents. The tuple is an element of the finite product ∏M_(f_i), before imposing compatibility on overlaps. It is not a global m∈M or one section in one localization. For a repeated cover f_1=f_2=1, tuple (0,1) in R×R is not compatible, though each entry is a valid local section. The unit-ideal cover ensures compatible tuples are images of global elements; that theorem does not follow from tuple formation alone. Finite tuple and arbitrary indexed-family conventions should remain visible.

Remaining: No external citation or whole-parent theorem certification; source/graph unchanged.

## 207. adjoining a solution of t^p-t=a — `missing.44e78265d78913479423`

**retain_distinct_missing**, 1/1 parents. Adjoining α means the smallest field K(α) containing K and the chosen root of X^p−X−a, not the element α alone. Any other root is α+c with c∈F_p, hence lies in the same generated field; the special polynomial makes one root adjunction a splitting field. This is a theorem for the Artin–Schreier polynomial, not a generic identity of root adjunction and splitting-field constructions. If a already has a solution in K, the field does not enlarge. The existing Artin–Schreier meaning names this special extension, so the operation versus whole-extension granularity needs care.

Remaining: Potential overlap with the existing Artin–Schreier extension concerns the whole special construction; preserve the chosen adjunction datum and do not create a self-resolution without adjudication.

## 208. upper bound of A in S — `missing.45310cd338bc1b5a6685`

**retain_distinct_missing**, 1/1 parents. An upper bound u belongs to S and dominates every a∈A; it need not belong to A or be least. For A=(0,1)⊂R both 1 and 2 are upper bounds, but only 1 is the supremum. Every u bounds ∅ vacuously when S has elements; this does not make an empty subset have a least upper bound in every poset. The parent excludes empty and unbounded subsets expressly. Bounded-above is existence of some bound, not the bound itself or completeness of the poset.

Remaining: No external citation or whole-parent theorem certification; source/graph unchanged.
